# -ffreestanding
#     A free-standing environment assumes nothing about typical
#     built-in C functions. Without it, the compiler might see
#     something like "strcpy" and optimise such call away with
#     special intructions. Basically, behave as if there is no
#     concept of a standard library.
# -W
#     Enable various common compiler warnings
# -Wall
#			Enable all general compiler warnings
#	-Wextra
#			Enable all extra compiler warnings
#	-Werror
#			Turn all warnings into errors
# -Wshadow
#			Warn about variable shadowing (re-definition of a variable
#			from an outer scope)
#	-Wwrite-strings
#			Implicitly give a `const` qualifier to all string constants
#			in the program
#	-Wconversion
#			Warn about implicit conversions
#	-Wcast-qual
#			Warn about pointer casting that drops qualifiers such as
#			`const`
