; Boot Loader
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; When the computer is turned on, it starts executing a firmware
; pre-installed on the system board called BIOS (Basic Input/Output
; System). The BIOS runs a "Power-On Self-Test" routine (POST) which
; checks, identifies, and initializes the CPU, RAM, video display,
; card, etc.
;
; Once all checks complete, the BIOS will go through each boot device
; (these devices and their priorities are usually configurable
; through the BIOS menu) in an attempt to find the "boot loader"
; software.
;
; In order to do so, the BIOS loads the first device's sector (the boot
; sector) (Cylinder 0, Head 0, Sector 0), 512 bytes, into memory at
; address 0x7c00. It uses previous addresses to setup its ISRs
; (interrupt service routines) and more.  Each interrupt is represented
; by an index to the interrupt vector table, added by the BIOS at
; address 0x0.
;
; If read was successful, it checks the bytes 511 (offset 0x1FE) and
; 512 (offset 0x1FF) are 0x55 and 0xAA respectively. This is known as
; the MBR signature.
;
; If the BIOS recognised a valid boot loader software, it will transfer
; control by executing a jump instruction to the boot loader's first
; byte in memory.
;
; The last 66 bytes of the 512-byte MBR are reserved for the  partition
; table and other information, so the MBR boot sector program must be
; small enough to fit within 446 bytes of memory or less.

; This boot loader is written in Intel x86 Assembly
; See http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html
; x86 CPUs have 4 general purpose registers: "ax", "bx", "cx", "dx",
; all of which can hold 2 bytes of data.

; "org" is an abbreviation for "origin address", and sets the
; "assembler location counter". It is used to specify the address that
; we expect a raw assembly program to be loaded at, so that, for
; convenience, all addresses we specify in the remaining program are
; offseted automatically from there.
; See https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.13.03/html/nasmdoc7.html#section-7.1.1

; BP and SP are registers that control the stack. BP points to the base
; of the stack, and SP points to the top of the stack.
; The stack grows down, and the SP register changes every time we push
; or pop the stack.
; Here we configure the stack to start a bit above the address where
; BIOS loads the boot loader so we have some room to breathe when
; growing down

; "db" defines an array of 1 byte elements. The assembler automatically

; "times" is a generic instruction provided by NASM that causes an
; instruction to be assembled multiple times. See
; https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc3.html
; The syntax is "times TO-FROM", and "$-$$" is a special symbol
; denoting the beginning of the current section. So this expression
; writes zeroes 510 times from the current section offset.

; The "db" directive declares 1 byte of data. So "db 0" is one byte of
; zeroes. Similarly, "dw 0" is two bytes of zeroes, and "dd" is four
; bytes of zeroes.
